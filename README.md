# Interactive AR app
An app where I have combined my coding, modelling, animations and Augmented Reality learning using Unity, C#, Vuforia and Maya.

## APK

[Download APK](/CS202-AR_Felipe.apk)

## How to use

1. Print or open [image_trigger.jpg](/image_trigger.jpg) in a different device.
2. Open the app and point it to the image. A plane ground will show on the top of the image. 
3. On the right border of the app, you can see a wheel, a forklift and a trident. You can grab any or all of them into the scene (there is a limit number for each thing). Green means you can place it, red means you need to place somewhere not to collide with another object.
4. After the object is placed on the scene you can press it to have a nice animation with both visiual and sound effect.

## Reflection

I learnt a lot with this 2 weeks project and I felt really pleasant to be able to put different works and technologies together. For this project I used:
- Unity: to develop and build the app. I also used the Particle System to create the visual effects;
- C#: to code custom scripts;
- Maya: to model and animate all three objects;
- Vuforia: to use Image Target.
